Unlike other chronic conditions, though, digestive diseases are often untreated or misdiagnosed...because of stigma. Over half of adults with digestive trouble admit they haven’t even consulted a provider about their symptoms. This is unfortunate because chronic digestive symptoms take a toll on home life, work performance, romance, and even simple social events. 

And digestive disease is expensive! For most companies, GI claims are the #2 healthcare expense, second only to cancer. Specialty drugs for inflammatory bowel disease can run $70k per year for just ONE employee.

Since 1980, we’ve been providing homes to the most challenged homeless adults in our community.

At the heart of Plymouth’s approach is the “Housing First” philosophy, a philosophy that has proven successful across the country. Without a stable home, homeless people cannot access the assistance they need to address their problems. Lack of a stable home exacerbates chronic medical and mental health conditions, making it very difficult to improve one’s life.

https://www.linkedin.com/company/love-in-faith,"Founders, Dave and Katie, met back in 2017. Brought together by their shared love for Jesus and their entrepreneurial spirit, they decided to start an online business that would make an impact in their community, something that would bring people together in a big way. They decided to start a clothing brand where the love of Jesus would be at the forefront. 

Growing up in the Christian community, they were discouraged by the faith-based apparel that was available to them. They were met with bland, impersonal Christian clothing that didn’t really reflect the fun and enthusiasm of being a believer in Christ. It was time they created their own faith-based apparel that showcased the unparalleled energy and joy that the Christian community had to offer—something that people would actually like to wear! 

They set off to work, learning as they went, spending every spare minute they could to grow the business in their own home. They worked tirelessly, often clocking in their workdays at 18 hours, 6 days a week, only taking days off to observe the Sabbath. At first, they were shipping orders out of their home, with the orders piling up and up and up on their kitchen counters. They knew something needed to change. They needed space—and a team to support their vision, too.

Since then, Love in Faith has become a beloved global brand. They’ve revolutionized what faith-based apparel can do for the community. With countless design options for clothing and accessories, they’ve provided a fun yet stylish way for believers to be supported in their faith, as well as a way to share the love of Jesus with the world. Through their passion to give back and be a source of hope, they’ve certainly proved that faith is always in style.

The ZogSports Story:
After his close call on September 11, 2001, Robert Herzog was inspired to create an organization which brought like-minded people together to have fun, give back and create community. He identified a need among New York's young professionals for better organized sports leagues and more natural social interactions outside of the workplace. Twenty-six teams kicked off ZogSports' 2002 launch, and now ZogSports is the nation's largest social sports community with over 120,000 people playing ever year and every team playing for charity.

Patients, providers, payers, and regulators are seeking a higher quality of care and better therapeutic benefits, along with reduced costs and enhanced transparency.

With a tremendous success rate, GForce Life Sciences has worked with some of the world’s leading pharmaceutical and medical device companies to address these challenges by providing consultants and executive-level candidates to assist our clients in delivering on the promises they have made to their clients (internal and external).

GForce recognizes that there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach to achieving growth and battling industry-wide challenges, therefore we begin with your specific needs and work from there to identify the consultant, team or executive that is the best fit.

Unlike larger, “factory firms,” our boutique approach allows us to hand-pick and closely monitor the best candidates for your company and projects.

Finally, we back our services with the industry’s leading technology infrastructure, assuring agile, transparent, personalized consulting solutions and business reporting intelligence.",51-200 employees,Staffing and Recruiting,GForce Life Sciences

https://www.linkedin.com/company/georgies-ceramic-&-clay-co-inc,"Family owned, local, and love serving our ceramic and art community. Curious where we came from and how we were started? 

Georgie's was established in 1965 under the name ""Irene's Objets d'Art"" by Seller Jacobson, Georgie's father. Georgie purchased the company in 1975 from her father and renamed it ""Georgie's Plaster Shoppe"". 

Plaster craft eventually faded, and Georgie's entered the field of ceramics in 1980. Hence, the name ""Georgie's Ceramic and Clay Co."" During the early 80's, Georgies' 3 kids graduated from the University of Oregon (Go Ducks!!) and rejoined the family business.

Sadly, Georgie passed away in 1985 at the early age of 48, after a decade-long battle with cancer. She died with the hope that her children would continue the company and follow her ideals of providing good service and a fun atmosphere for both employees and customers.

And let me tell you - that's just what they've done. 

Currently in the third generation of owners, Georgie's ideals live on as the youngest of Georgie's children, Linda, continues to grow this business. We can't wait to see what Linda's daughter, Melanie, will do as future fourth generation owner.

We have the most amazing employees who put their heart and soul into their job. And lastly (or should we say the most important piece) we have the most outstanding and creative customers. Thank you for supporting our local, family owned business!

https://www.linkedin.com/company/juul-labs,"Juul Labs is a thriving team of scientists, engineers, designers and professionals who are committed to offering adult smokers alternatives to combustible cigarettes, while combating underage use of our products. JUUL products are designed to transition adult smokers from combustible cigarettes by providing a competitive nicotine experience.

Product

Juul Labs’ technology was developed in support of our mission. The JUUL product consists of two main components: e-liquid and the JUUL device. JUUL e-liquid aims to provide a nicotine experience similar to combustible cigarette use. The JUUL device is built to deliver this e-liquid as a vapor while maintaining a low temperature regulation system designed to minimize combustion.

Revolutionary thinking

Adam Bowen and James Monsees co-founded Juul Labs when they applied their background in product design to the challenge of finding a true alternative to smoking combustible cigarettes. As smokers for many years,  they could find no acceptable alternative. Adam and James recognized an opportunity to apply industrial design to the tobacco industry. The result was the JUUL product.

Our commitment

We understand that trust in our company and category has eroded with our stakeholders and it is our responsibility to earn back that trust through our actions. To earn a license to operate in society, we are putting stakeholder trust at the center of what we do and make choices that are informed by the views of our stakeholders, including and especially our regulators.

Our intent

Our customer base is the world’s one billion adult smokers. We do not want any non-nicotine users, especially those underage, to try our products as they exist only to transition the world’s one billion adult smokers away from combustible cigarettes. We believe smokers should first and foremost quit. But for those who cannot or will not quit, access to alternatives to combustible cigarettes and accurate information about those alternatives is critical.","1,001-5,000 employees",Manufacturing,Juul Labs

TaylorMade has a history of innovative industry-leading products such as the groundbreaking Stealth 2 Carbonwood™ Drivers, TP5/TP5x Golf Balls and P·Series irons.

History:
In the spring of 1979 a golf equipment salesman named Gary Adams took out a $24,000 loan on his home and founded the TaylorMade Golf Company. He rented a 6,000 square-foot building that at one time housed a television assembly plant. Counting him, there were three employees and a single, innovative product: a 12-degree driver cast of stainless steel. This new metalwood looked and sounded different from a wooden wood, and most important, it performed differently. The clubhead's perimeter-weighting offered greater forgiveness on mis-hits, while the lower center of gravity made it easier to launch the ball in the air. Adams, the son of a golf professional, was adamant that TaylorMade clubs maintain ties to what true golfers perceived an authentic golf club should look and feel like. They were committed to combining innovation with authenticity, to always be passionate about the game, and pledged to be competitive - to work hard to establish itself and grow. These four tenets would take them far.

Since the creation of the first metalwood in 1979, the TaylorMade Golf Company has established a legacy of breaking from tradition to reach new thresholds of performance. ","1,001-5,000 employees",Sporting Goods Manufacturing,TaylorMade Golf Company

Here is a testimonial from one of our valued employees:

""I joined Agile Premier a year ago because I was looking for something different. After several interviews with other local companies, I wasn’t sure that I was going to find what I was looking for. The LAST thing I wanted to do was repeat a mistake from the past. I thought I might have to give this business up. Luckily, I was referred to Stephen through a dear friend. Here is what I was looking for: I wanted full freedom to do business how I do it, go get the business I was attracted to regardless of geography, have support rather than micromanagement, have tools to make my job easier, be able to recruit or sell, and finally – leave the cube life FOREVER. 
 
It’s been a year now. I can say I made a good decision for myself. I am proud to say I am the top revenue producer here and I attribute this to the freedom I am given to be who I am rather than what a Corporation or its stockholders want me to be. ""

THE INSIDER'S NETWORK
We’ve been networking with San Diego’s biotech firms before you knew you were ready to make a career change. When you register with us, we plug you into an existing network of companies that don’t always post to job boards. You will have access to unique opportunities throughout the greater San Diego area - opportunities you won’t find on your own.


THANK YOU FOR CALLING
We’ve picked up that old book on customer service, dusted it off, and put it back into practice. How many times have you left a message and never heard back? How many recruiting firms have you sent your resume to who haven’t called you back promptly? At Simply Biotech, customer service is our priority. We return calls promptly. We don’t let you fall through the cracks. It sounds so simple yet so few know how to do it right.

THE IMPORTANCE OF A FIRM HANDSHAKE
There is no substitute for meeting someone in person. It is the only way to really understand people. We interview all of our candidates in person before they interview at our client companies to ensure the best possible fit. Also, we visit every biotech company in person, meet the people involved in the decision, get a feel for the company culture, and get a thorough understanding of the job. We won’t waste your time because we’re committed to understanding exactly what it is you’re looking for.",51-200 employees,Staffing and Recruiting,Simply Biotech

We’ve grown to meet this challenge, investing in technology, global resources and a network of the world’s most integrated glassmaking facilities and processes.

But the greatest investment is the one made by our people – generations of highly trained glassmakers who take pride in crafting everything we imagine, touch, test and deliver.

The origins of Carlex can be traced back to 1936 when Central Glass Co. Ltd., then known as Ube Soda Industry Co. Ltd., was established in Japan. In 1958, the company launched it's glass business, followed by the acquisition of a North American architectural glass facility in Seattle, WA in 1974, and then opening its first major automotive glass facility in Vonore, TN in 1991 in partnership with Ford Motor Company.

Carlex has continually focused on one thing: a commitment to excellence in providing the best automotive glass products to its global customers. This has been a springboard as Carlex grew from the single Vonore facility in 1995, to the 2011 purchase of Ford’s former Nashville, TN float glass, fabrication operations, and the aftermarket business which doubled its North American footprint. Carlex  doubled its size in 2014 by acquiring three manufacturing sites in Auburn and Ligonier, IN and Grevenmacher, Luxembourg.

Our parent company, Fisher Sand & Gravel Co., was founded in rural North Dakota in 1952 by Gene Fisher. Through Gene’s vision and leadership, Fisher Sand & Gravel quickly emerged as a leader in portable crushing operations. In the years that followed, Gene recognized a need for durable, customizable equipment. In 1967 he established the affiliate company, General Steel & Supply Co., to repair, remodel, design, and fabricate quality aggregate processing equipment. This partnership fueled the further success of Fisher Sand & Gravel leading to the establishment of several more office locations in the upper Midwest.
In the mid-1990s, Gene Fisher turned over the reins of his enterprise to his eldest son and current company president, Tommy Fisher. Exhibiting his father’s same ambition, Tommy expanded our operations to Arizona and markets in the southwest United States. Today, known by the trade name of Fisher Industries, our services include concrete, asphalt, drilling, blasting, and paving, as well as various aggregate products. We have recently entered into our third generation of Fisher ingenuity and acumen with Tommy’s sons, Grant and Ryan, becoming involved in the company.
Working as a unified team, Fisher Industries continues to pursue and successfully tackle the industry’s toughest jobs. Bridges, levees, roads, and walls, we do it all

Stride Funding, named the 2022 Startup of the Year by Startup Boston, is a venture-backed, mission-driven company that is transforming access to education with innovative forms of financing. We work to increase educational access by leveraging alternative data sets, innovative modeling techniques, and school-support funding to offer outcomes-driven financing products (e.g. income share loans, deferred tuition agreements, and employer sponsored programs) on the basis of students’ future career trajectory—rather than their historical family credit profile.

In the past year, we’ve closed the largest Income Share Loan fund in history, raising $105 million to support non-degree students in high-quality bootcamps, and launched groundbreaking programs to support students at schools ranging from Stanford Law School to General Assembly. Charging ahead on our student-centric mission, Stride Funding has become the largest player in the outcomes-based financing market, supporting students at more than 150 schools and bootcamp programs across the country, with over $135mm in servicing. 

Our team has grown 3x in the last year, and we’re not stopping any time soon. Joining the Stride Squad means playing a role in creating meaningful change, doing work you truly love, while surrounded by a team that shares your passion! 

🚀 Join the Stride Squad 🚀

We’re a tight-knit, mission-driven team of engineers, data scientists, product designers, marketers, program managers, analysts, and more. Stride was built by students, for students—and as we grow, we never want to lose sight of our mission. We’re inquisitive go-getters, and passionate about what we do. We drive impact, both for our students and within our teams, and use data to power innovation and decision-making. We strive to be:

https://www.linkedin.com/company/caseys,"In 1959, Founder Don Lamberti leased a store from his father on East 14th and Broadway in Des Moines, Iowa. After nine years of operating this old country store, which he remodeled into a convenience store, Don's gas supplier and friend Kurvin C. Fish, suggested that Don buy the Square Deal Oil Company.
 
Don followed his advice and purchased the service station with a three-bay garage in Boone, Iowa. Using the knowledge from his store in Des Moines, Don converted the gas station into a convenience store. The Boone store was named ""Casey's"" by using Kurvin C. Fish's initials.
 
The third store was built in another small community with a population of only 1,500 - Waukee, Iowa. This was the first Casey's built totally from scratch and proved to be the best store yet.

A LETTER FROM PETER FINN:

DECEMBER 2011. FINN PARTNERS WAS BORN. After 11 years serving as co-CEO of a historic agency that carried my father’s name— and mine!—and after 30+ years of working at the firm, I wanted to build something different, bold, meaningful and amazing for clients, our colleagues and the community. ""Amazing"" was, and is, for me an important word. I imagined we could be ""amazing"" every day, knowing this is a goal not always achieved but always pursued. A place where talented people could gather and do big things for clients as well as make a difference to the communities important to us.

WE LAUNCHED WITH A GROUP WHO SHARED A VISION. This was to be a ""new"" agency model, driven by a collaborative spirit. We asked, ""Can we bind our 60-year legacy to the energy and speed of today’s hi-tech world?"" We had $24 million in fees at our founding. Today, we have more than $85 million in fees, over 700 colleagues and 18 offices across three continents. Our Founding Managing Partners, highly respected colleagues who took the leap with me from our former agency, have been joined by the principals of other great agencies that became Finn Partner companies. So many other talented individuals are with us, too, intrigued by the idea of doing amazing things in an amazing workplace community.

WE’VE MADE OUR MARK QUICKLY. Finn Partners has been named “Best New Agency,” “Best PR Agency to Work for in North America” and“Best Mid-Sized Agency of the Year” three times. Now, we’re one of the world’s largest agencies.

WE ARE A YOUNG AGENCY. We share the genes of a respected agency that pioneered today’s integrated communications. But we are not them. We are unique. We are ourselves. We are focused on the future, building that future during each amazing day.","1,001-5,000 employees",Advertising Services,

Today, the US Military Veteran returning from active duty abroad is increasingly being shut out of IT Jobs due to off shoring, lack of experience, lack of training or a combination of both. The “Veterans Sourcing Group” solution combines the talents of the C&L Group professionals who currently compete with the Indian Outsourcers with the veteran experiences of its JV partner to provide the necessary training, coaching, guidance and placement services to our Veterans to locate and succeed in these high tech jobs. Veterans Sourcing Group, a SDVOB designated firm, is in position to receive preferential treatment by Industry and Government in the award of contracts that may otherwise have gone offshore.

Companies with active “Diversity Programs” are able to include VSG spend and or staff augmentation headcount in fulfillment of their diversity and minority goals as a result of our 51% ownership by a Service Disabled Veteran.

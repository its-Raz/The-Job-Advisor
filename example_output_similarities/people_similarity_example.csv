michael-thibault-a4134816,"Michael has one underlining goal that drives Strategic Marketing Systems- to make his clients more money with little to no work on their part. He has owned 6 different businesses in the food-service industry starting each from scratch and then growing them into multi-million dollar businesses, employing hundreds of people at a time. He built his catering company into one of the top grossing catering firms in the country which was started in his grandmother‚Äôs basement. Because of his success in the food-service industry, specifically the catering field, people began to seek Michael out for advice on how to start, build and market catering divisions for their restaurants. This lead to Michael speaking at many seminars around the country on how to successfully market a catering business. Michael then started a consulting firm to help restaurant and catering owners to grow their business. After consulting with several hundred restaurants and caterers Michael developed a Done For You Marketing service for clients. He then expanded into several other niches helping clients in the retail, automotive repair, and chiropractic and healthcare industries to increase sales all with no work on his client‚Äôs part.

victoria-surber-b88044207,"Hi, my name is Victoria Surber. I am graduating in December with my degree in biochemistry from the University of Maryland. I have a strong interest in preforming scientific research. I have centered my coursework around being in a laboratory setting and learning about different methods of research. I have a wide knowledge of different types of instrumentation, procedures, and skills that will aide me in a professional laboratory setting. I chose to enhance my understanding of scientific methods to prepare myself for hands on experience outside of the classroom. I have completed numerous experiments and written full scientific research reports. I also have experience outside of an academic setting in a managerial position. This position enhanced my organizational and problem-solving skills both of which are important and easily transferrable to a position in science.

steven-stitt-01aa44a,"Manage all aspects of the Williams Sonoma conversion from legacy systems to Oracle Procure to Pay. Ensure all testing and implementation steps were completed and functioning as expected. Spearhead the conversion from Coupa (legacy system) to the Oracle Procurement Module. Ensure smooth transition for uploads from vendors transitioning to a new FBDI spreadsheet for Oracle. Track and ensure all Procurement steps are completed for conversion as well as perform the tasks assigned to Procurement. Manage the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module implementation. Provide training for field and corporate Procurement users. Assist the AP team with roll out ensuring all testing was completed for invoicing and PO matching. ÔÇß Hired in June of 2019 by Williams Sonoma Inc. (WSI) (through Robert Half) to help get the Procurement team on track with the conversion from Coupa to Oracle P2P. ÔÇß After working with implementation team was able to make Procurement the first department fully ready to implement and transition to Oracle. ÔÇß When the project was pushed to 2020, I was asked to extend my contract and assist both the Procurement and the Accounts Payable departments.

kris44dad,"I am a CPA in the state of IL with a technical background. Most of my time is spent with financial statements and the care and maintenance of the systems that produce them. I have experience with the various QuickBooks flavors of course but I have used others, as I run across them. Moving from client to client requires the ability to adapt to whatever environment you are working in. My database administration background helps me get an intuitive picture of how the management system is structured and operates (or not operating). I also engage in process improvement and documentation. When I am called in it‚Äôs as backfill for someone who is leaving. Often, the company realizes they didn‚Äôt have a clear definition of what the former employee did, and now they‚Äôre in a bind. I correct that.

craighibbardohio,"My journey started a long time back building PCs for friends in college. I'm happy to say I'm still a ""tech guy"" even though I've been a Project Manager for quite a few years since. I love running projects, each new project has it's own challenges and opportunities to learn. In Feb. 2021 I finally achieved my PMP Certfication from the Project Management Institute (PMI). In the past I've learned how to setup a LMS to use as a recruiting filter, I learned how to build teams even in highly-matrixed worldwide datacenter environments. I learned how to manage getting 60 people on planes and into their hotels every week.

gary-fote-jr-522b6a4a,"I was very fortunate with my first job in IT. Working at PerceptIS has given me a lot of valuable experience. Much of that has to be credited to working with some wonderful and very bright people. My first assignment was working on campus at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). It was great working with people that were extremely knowledgeable about so many different facets of the IT field. I gained a solid understanding of troubleshooting different issues. This involved working with Windows and Macintosh machines as well as mobile devices and printers. I then moved to supporting the University of Virginia as a Tier I Help Desk consultant. One of the great things about working with higher education is the variety of issues. Things are not standardized as is common in a typical business settings. UVa utilized Exchange, Google Apps, and another email system. That exposes a person to all three which they may not get in many other places. I believe that this variety is what makes me a great asset when it comes to troubleshooting client issues. I do everything I can to solve a caller's issue during the initial contact. There are issues that do require escalation. However, I am able to resolve the majority of calls received without further assistance. Most recently, I worked at the Sherwin-Williams Global Service Desk as an employee of Exodus Integrity Systems. I was initially brought in to help with migrating employees to Office 365. Fortunately, I was kept on and provided support to employees for problems relating to PC, iOS devices, and Sherwin-specific programs/apps. Having been in various IT support roles throughout the last 14 years I realize the importance of great customer service. A person should NEVER feel reticent to contact their technology support team/department.

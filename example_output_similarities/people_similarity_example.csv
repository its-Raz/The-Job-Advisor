michael-thibault-a4134816,"Michael has one underlining goal that drives Strategic Marketing Systems- to make his clients more money with little to no work on their part. He has owned 6 different businesses in the food-service industry starting each from scratch and then growing them into multi-million dollar businesses, employing hundreds of people at a time. He built his catering company into one of the top grossing catering firms in the country which was started in his grandmother’s basement. Because of his success in the food-service industry, specifically the catering field, people began to seek Michael out for advice on how to start, build and market catering divisions for their restaurants. This lead to Michael speaking at many seminars around the country on how to successfully market a catering business. Michael then started a consulting firm to help restaurant and catering owners to grow their business. After consulting with several hundred restaurants and caterers Michael developed a Done For You Marketing service for clients. He then expanded into several other niches helping clients in the retail, automotive repair, and chiropractic and healthcare industries to increase sales all with no work on his client’s part.

victoria-surber-b88044207,"Hi, my name is Victoria Surber. I am graduating in December with my degree in biochemistry from the University of Maryland. I have a strong interest in preforming scientific research. I have centered my coursework around being in a laboratory setting and learning about different methods of research. I have a wide knowledge of different types of instrumentation, procedures, and skills that will aide me in a professional laboratory setting. I chose to enhance my understanding of scientific methods to prepare myself for hands on experience outside of the classroom. I have completed numerous experiments and written full scientific research reports. I also have experience outside of an academic setting in a managerial position. This position enhanced my organizational and problem-solving skills both of which are important and easily transferrable to a position in science.

kris44dad,"I am a CPA in the state of IL with a technical background. Most of my time is spent with financial statements and the care and maintenance of the systems that produce them. I have experience with the various QuickBooks flavors of course but I have used others, as I run across them. Moving from client to client requires the ability to adapt to whatever environment you are working in. My database administration background helps me get an intuitive picture of how the management system is structured and operates (or not operating). I also engage in process improvement and documentation. When I am called in it’s as backfill for someone who is leaving. Often, the company realizes they didn’t have a clear definition of what the former employee did, and now they’re in a bind. I correct that. And if they have an interest in improvement along the way, so much the better.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQGK7Ju-y1wvVA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1517689059845?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=a4iHcGdOr-rr4oEYR5Ofj406ePS54GunxBJXPdvS9b8,"[{""meta"":""Issued Aug 2014 Expires Sep 2018 Credential ID 065.043807 See credential"",""subtitle"":""State of Illinois"",""title"":""Licensed Certified Public Accountant""}]","Aurora, Illinois, United States",US,"{""company_id"":""robert-half-international"",""industry"":""Robert Half"",""link"":""https://pe.linkedin.com/company/robert-half-international?trk=public_profile_topcard-current-company"",""name"":""Robert Half"",""title"":""Accountant - various clients""}",robert-half-international,Robert Half,"[{""degree"":""BS Business & Commerce/Accounting"",""end_year"":""2013"",""field"":""accounting"",""meta"":""2010 - 2013 Activities and Societies: East Asian Cultural Society"",""start_year"":""2010"",""title"":""Aurora University"",""url"":""https://pe.linkedin.com/school/aurora-university/?trk=public_profile_school_profile-section-card_image-click""},{""degree"":""A.A.S"",""end_year"":""1987"",""field"":""Data Processing/Computer Science"",""meta"":""1985 - 1987"",""start_year"":""1985"",""title"":""Waubonsee Community College"",""url"":""https://pe.linkedin.com/school/waubonsee/?trk=public_profile_school_profile-section-card_image-click""},{""degree"":""Diploma"",""end_year"":""1981"",""field"":""General"",""meta"":""1978 - 1981 Activities and Societies: Football (Manager) General studies and manager of the football team."",""start_year"":""1978"",""title"":""East Aurora High School"",""url"":null}]",null,"[{""company"":null,""company_id"":null,""description"":null,""duration"":""May 2022 - Present 1 year 5 months"",""duration_short"":""1 year 5 months"",""end_date"":""Present"",""location"":""Illinois, United States"",""positions"":null,""start_date"":""May 2022"",""subtitle"":""Robert Half"",""subtitleURL"":""https://pe.linkedin.com/company/robert-half-international?trk=public_profile_experience-item_profile-section-card_subtitle-click"",""title"":""Accountant"",""url"":null},{""company"":null,""company_id"":null,""description"":""I was hired to complete accounting entries for the 2nd half of 2011, reconcile the resulting cash account balance, and submit the year end trial balances and statements to our outside accounting firm in time for the 2011 tax filing.

Like any fast-paced industry, recruiters can definitely be seen as cutthroat and it's easy to feel like another number in the mix of candidate pools. It is completely different with Jesse in the best possible ways. He is genuinely interested in trying to help YOU through that process to really make the right match that will allow you to thrive. He has such a good natured, calming presence about him and if there is a way that he can help, you can bet he will be the first to offer up any guidance, coaching, insights, or motivating words. Of all the recruiters I've worked with and met, Jesse was immediately the one that stood out and I personally have always been a bit skeptical because of the reputation recruiters often have. Feeling like I was chatting with a friend who really cared about helping me through this process was so valuable and completely energized me in my job hunt! I would recommend him to anyone who is in this process and looking for someone completely authentic with a desire to help.”"",""Joseph Johnson “I can not recommend Jesse enough.

gary-fote-jr-522b6a4a,"I was very fortunate with my first job in IT. Working at PerceptIS has given me a lot of valuable experience. Much of that has to be credited to working with some wonderful and very bright people. My first assignment was working on campus at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). It was great working with people that were extremely knowledgeable about so many different facets of the IT field. I gained a solid understanding of troubleshooting different issues. This involved working with Windows and Macintosh machines as well as mobile devices and printers. I then moved to supporting the University of Virginia as a Tier I Help Desk consultant. One of the great things about working with higher education is the variety of issues. Things are not standardized as is common in a typical business settings. UVa utilized Exchange, Google Apps, and another email system. That exposes a person to all three which they may not get in many other places. I believe that this variety is what makes me a great asset when it comes to troubleshooting client issues. I do everything I can to solve a caller's issue during the initial contact. There are issues that do require escalation. However, I am able to resolve the majority of calls received without further assistance. Most recently, I worked at the Sherwin-Williams Global Service Desk as an employee of Exodus Integrity Systems. I was initially brought in to help with migrating employees to Office 365. Fortunately, I was kept on and provided support to employees for problems relating to PC, iOS devices, and Sherwin-specific programs/apps. Having been in various IT support roles throughout the last 14 years I realize the importance of great customer service. A person should NEVER feel reticent to contact their technology support team/department.

edu-navarrete,"Business Analyst Professional that enjoys creating business strategies based on Data Analysis and Business knowledge within fast-paced environments. That is why when I was 18 years old I started my career as a Financial Analyst at one of the top Investment Banking companies in the world. There I implemented solutions and optimized processes by analyzing financial data and market trends using Microsoft Office with an advanced level of Excel and Bloomberg, as well as a deep understanding of customer needs. With a Masters's in International Business and Business Analytics, I was able to participate in several projects where I applied my analysis skills by leveraging other powerful tools for data analysis including SQL and Python, as well as Data Visualization tools like Tableau and CRM Systems. I’m well-versed in creating a detailed Business Analysis, outlining problems, opportunities, and solutions for businesses. Thanks to my interpersonal and consultative skills I have been able to contribute to businesses' success by achieving set goals and expectations. I’d love to hear from you.

Especially as she is very up front and honest about all expectations. Secondly, Catherine has great time management skills. When she didn’t know a detail, she always found the correct information and got back to me within a day. Despite working in different time zones, she is always quick to respond and adjusts meeting schedules seamlessly.

An example would be his successful management of a special initiative team responsible for reducing the volume of delinquent accounts transitioning from newly delinquent into cycle collection groups. These accounts required significant investigation, above and beyond normal account management. Through this initiative his team reduced the transitioning volume by approx 15%, which had a direct impact on the success of the Center.

The platform uses advanced math and science to generate the most persuasive language for digital communications intended to drive action.

Anytime I need a project done, I can trust her to not only complete it but to critically think about the most efficient way to do so and any improvements she can make in my proposed system. She has a great relationship with our students and they trust her to help them with the advising process. Tejashree is also not afraid to ask for help when needed, rather than give wrong information. Perhaps most impressively, Tejashree is constantly asking if there is more she can do to help the office and she seems to thrive when given a challenging workload.
